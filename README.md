# Raindrops kata in Python
## Setting up the project
To set up the project: 
1. Set up a python environment on your system
2. clone this repo

## Testing
After setting up the project, run tests in the command linewith the following commands:
```
python -m pytest
```
This will run the automated tests.

## Project run down
This was much more challenging than the Raindrops kata I completed in Ruby as Python is a relatively new language to me and I'm still new to its syntax and systems. I enjoyed test-driving this project and found myself learning a lot about how Python is structured and used.


## Final Thoughts

I will continue learning and experimenting in Python as I really enjoy the language and it's potential uses. I encountered a few problems with this project, such as having to trick the pytest framework into working in another directory by adding an empty conftest.py file to the src folder. The final code in the Raindrops method is inspired from [a five year old solution](https://exercism.io/tracks/python/exercises/raindrops/solutions/e75aefcde5cf92b970488166) to this kata and so I used this project to gain clarity on the language. When I have gained more visibility in Python I will re-attempt this project with my own solution.
